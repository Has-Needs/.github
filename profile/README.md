#### We're glad you're here!  
Has-Needs is a next-generation humanitarian coordination protocol—open, composable, and designed to empower individuals and organizations to meet real-world needs efficiently.

**Has-Needs** was designed for trauma-mitigating disaster logistics but because it provides a sovereignty-based 'forest' of Personal Receipt Chains, it offers oh so much more.
