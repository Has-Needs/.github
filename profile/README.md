#### We're glad you're here!  
Has-Needs is a next-generation humanitarian coordination protocol—open, composable, and designed to empower individuals and organizations to meet real-world needs efficiently.

**Has-Needs** was designed for trauma-mitigating disaster logistics but because it provides a sovereignty-based 'forest' of Personal Receipt Chains, it offers so much more. Like:  

- Accountable Governance
- Post-Capitalist Economy
- Local-First Ecosystem
- Project based Ad-Hocracy
- Merit-Based Interaction
- Emergent Resource Mapping
- Literacy Agnostic UI
- Technology Agnostic IO
- Emergent Ontologies
- Right to be Forgotten
- Jurisdiction Agnostic Evidence
- Zero Knowledge-Zero Exposure
- Human Moderated "Safe" AI
